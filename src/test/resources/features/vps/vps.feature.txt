    Example: The one where Rusty purchases a basic package online
      Given Rusty is not an existing customer
      When Rusty selects the following package:
        | Package Type | Memory Option | Monthly/Yearly |
        | Basic        | SSD           | Yearly         |
      And Rusty completes the order process by creating a new account
